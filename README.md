# Asana API PHP class

A dependency free, lightweight PHP class that acts as wrapper for Asana API.  
Lets make things fast and easy! :)

## Installing

Choose your favourite flavour

- Download the php class from Github.
- Or use [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/ajimix/asana-api-php-class) PHP package manager.

Finally require the asana.php file.

## Working with the class

First declare the asana class

```php
$asana = new Asana([
    'personalAccessToken' => 'GET_IT_FROM_ASANA'
]);
```

*Optionally you can pass an accessToken instead of a personalAccessToken if you use OAuth. Read [Using Asana Oauth Tokens](#using-asana-oauth-tokens) below for more info.*

#### Creating a task

```php
$asana->createTask([
   'workspace' => '176825', // Workspace ID
   'name' => 'Hello World!', // Name of task
   'assignee' => 'bigboss@bigcompany.com', // Assign task to...
   'followers' => ['3714136', '5900783'] // We add some followers to the task... (this time by ID)
]);
```

Creating a task for another assignee than yourself will mark the task as private by
default. This results in the task not being available for modification through the
API anymore. Take a look at the [API Reference](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/tasks)
for more fields of the Task you can directly pass to `createTask`.

#### Adding task to project

```php
$asana->addProjectToTask('THIS_TASK_ID_PLEASE', 'TO_THIS_COOL_PROJECT_ID');
```

#### Commenting on a task

```php
$asana->commentOnTask('MY_BEAUTIFUL_TASK_ID', 'Please please! Don\'t assign me this task!');
```

#### Getting projects in all workspaces

```php
$asana->getProjects();
```

#### Updating project info

```php
$asana->updateProject('COOL_PROJECT_ID', [
    'name' => 'This is a new cool project!',
    'notes' => 'At first, it wasn\'t cool, but after this name change, it is!'
]);
```

#### Do more

There are a [lot more methods](https://github.com/ajimix/asana-api-php-class/blob/master/asana.php) to do almost everything with asana.

See the examples [inside examples folder](https://github.com/ajimix/asana-api-php-class/tree/master/examples), read the comments on the [class file]((https://github.com/ajimix/asana-api-php-class/blob/master/asana.php)) for class magic and read [Asana API documentation](http://developer.asana.com/documentation/) if you want to be a master.

If a method returned some data, you can always retrieve it by calling.

```php
$asana->getData();
```

If you miss some functionality, open a pull request and it will be merged as soon as possible.

Enjoy ;D

## Using Asana OAuth tokens

To use this API, you can also create an App on Asana to get an oAuth access token, then include the class:

```php
require_once('asana-oauth.php');
```

Declare the oAuth class as:

```php
$asanaAuth = new AsanaAuth('YOUR_APP_ID', 'YOUR_APP_SECRET', 'CALLBACK_URL');
$url = $asanaAuth->getAuthorizeUrl();
```

Where YOUR_APP_ID, YOUR_APP_SECRET and CALLBACK_URL you get from your App's details on Asana. Now, redirect the browser to the result held by $url. The user will be asked to login & accept your app, after which the browser will be returned to the CALLBACK_URL, which should process the result:

```php
$code = $_GET['code'];
$asanaAuth->getAccessToken($code);
```

And you will receive an object with the access token and a refresh token
The token expires after one hour so you can refresh it doing the following:

```php
$asanaAuth->refreshAccessToken('ACCESS_TOKEN');
```

For a more detailes instructions on how to make oauth work check the example in examples/oauth.php
